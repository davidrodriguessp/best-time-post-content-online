# Best Time to Post Technology Content Online

Technology evolves quickly and requires constant update for the ones following the subject. Professionals and journalists that produce content related to the matter should not only provide relevant information, but also choose the right medium and time to share it.

The aim of this analysis is to verify the best day of the week and time of the day to post technology content online, in order to maximize the level of reach, engagement and comments.

We analyzed a dataset with posting information from popular technology website Hacker News. It allows authors to post questions, projects and products. The website users - mainly technology and start-up professionals - can comment and vote upon contents. The dataset was extracted from the website Kaggle and is available in this repository.

The analysis reveals that new posts tend to reach the highest level of engagement on Sundays, at 3 p.m. (Eastern Time in the U.S. - NYC time). In this day and time, content tend to get the highest number of the comments from the community.

In this repository you will find two files:

- Best_Time_Post_Content_Online.ipynb -  with the complete Jupyter Notebook and analysis.
- hacker_news.csv - with the datafile we used for the analysis.
