Technology evolves quickly and requires constant update for the ones following the subject. Professionals and journalists that produce content related to the matter should not only provide relevant information, but also choose the right medium and time to share it.

The objective of this analysis is to verify the best time of the day to post technology content online, in order to maximize the level of reach, engagement and comments.

We analyzed a dataset with posting information from the technology website Hacker News. It allows authors to post questions, projects and products. The website users - mainly technoloty and start-up professionals - can comment and vote upon contents. The dataset was extracted from the website [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) and can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/keplaxo/hacker-news). 

The analysis reveals that new posts tend to reach the highest level of engagement at 3 p.m. (Eastern Time in the U.S.). At this hour, content tend to get the highest number of the comments from the community.
